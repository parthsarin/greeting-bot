Hey <@{user_id}>, welcome to Schiff! :wave:

We, your dorm staff, are SO excited to welcome you here in a few short weeks and we’ve been eagerly preparing for your arrival by decorating the dorm to match this year’s theme: StarSchiff!

When you get to campus, you’ll have to quarantine for ten days; before that’s over, the entire dorm will be operating virtually. Virtual community can feel daunting, but we’ve got a bunch of fun ideas to help you get to know each other while we can’t mingle!

:fast_forward: You’ve been added to the <#C01JHBWL7S5> channel. Head over there and post a message with your name, pronouns, and something you’ve been up to in quarantine to keep busy.
:fast_forward: Meet your neighbors! On Slack you can send DMs to people and we think it’d be really fun if you could send a DM to one of your neighbors to introduce yourself and chat :relaxed:. You should also expect to receive a message from your other neighbor!
:fast_forward: Join an interest group! We’ve created some channels where you can play games with each other, learn each other’s faces and names, and more. Feel free to make your own, but so far, we’ve made: <#C01J5SZSX7U>, <#C01JRTNF33J>, #crochet, #fried-chicken.

Schiff Love,
Your Staff
